                                Requirements Engineering:
5.What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirements Engineering:

Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements for a software system. It involves activities such as eliciting requirements from stakeholders, analyzing and negotiating requirements, specifying and documenting requirements, validating requirements, and managing requirements throughout the project lifecycle.

Process:

Elicitation: Gathering requirements from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, observation, and other techniques.

Analysis: Analyzing the gathered requirements to understand their feasibility, relevance, and priority.

Specification: Documenting the requirements in a clear and detailed manner, typically in a requirements specification document.

Validation: Ensuring that the documented requirements accurately reflect the stakeholders' needs and are feasible for implementation.

Management: Managing changes to requirements and ensuring that all stakeholders are aware of the current requirements throughout the project.

Importance:

Clear Vision: Provides a clear understanding of what the software needs to achieve.
Alignment: Ensures all stakeholders have a common understanding of the requirements.
Scope Management: Helps in managing scope and preventing scope creep.

                                  Software Design Principles:
6.Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity refers to the design principle of breaking down a software system into smaller, manageable, and independent modules or components. Each module encapsulates a specific functionality and interacts with other modules through well-defined interfaces.

Improvement in Maintainability and Scalability:

Maintainability: Modular design makes it easier to understand, test, and maintain the software. Changes to one module can be made independently without affecting other modules, thus reducing the risk of introducing new bugs.

Scalability: Modularity allows for easier scaling of the software system. New features can be added by developing new modules without needing to overhaul the entire system. It also facilitates the distribution of workloads across multiple developers or teams.

                                  Testing in Software Engineering:
7.Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unit Testing: Testing individual components or units of code in isolation to ensure they work correctly. Typically performed by developers.

Integration Testing: Testing the interactions between integrated units or components to ensure they work together as expected.

System Testing: Testing the complete and integrated software system to verify that it meets the specified requirements. This includes testing both functional and non-functional aspects.

Acceptance Testing: Testing the software from the end-user's perspective to ensure it meets their needs and requirements. This is often the final testing phase before deployment.

Importance of Testing:

Quality Assurance: Ensures the software meets the desired quality standards.
Bug Detection: Identifies and resolves defects and issues before the software is deployed to users.
Reliability: Enhances the reliability and stability of the software system.
User Satisfaction: Ensures that the software meets user expectations and requirements, leading to higher user satisfaction.
